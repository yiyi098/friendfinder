###Overview
This is an app deployed on Heroku that uses a personality survey to collect a series of scores and compares it to other users' scores to find the best matching friend.

###How to Use
The homepage contains a button that leads to the survey and two footer links that lead to the users' info API and the Github repository.

The survey itself requires the user to provide his or her name and photo, and answer all 10 questions, each with a score of 1 through 5.

After filling out the survey, a modal will show the matching friend's name and photo.
